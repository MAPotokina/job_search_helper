## Rules

### ✅ WHAT TO DO

- **Strictly follow tasklist.md** - no deviations
- **Agree BEFORE implementation** - show key code snippets
- **Wait for confirmations** - after agreement and after tests
- **Update tasklist.md** - statuses and checkboxes
- **Follow conventions.md** - all code rules
- **KISS** - simplest solutions
- **Commit after each iteration**

### ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

- ❌ Write code without agreement
- ❌ Move to next iteration without confirmation
- ❌ Skip tests
- ❌ Forget to update tasklist.md
- ❌ Add functionality not in the plan
- ❌ Overcomplicate solutions
- ❌ Do multiple iterations in a row
- ❌ Commit without passing tests

## Communication Template

### Iteration Start
```
🚀 Starting Iteration X: [Name]

Tasks:
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

Proposed solution:
[description + key code snippets]

Agree?
```

### After Implementation
```
✅ Iteration X: [Name] completed

Updated progress in tasklist.md

Test:
[test commands]

Expected:
[what should happen]

Please test.
```

### After Test Confirmation
```
📝 Making commit:
git commit -m "Iteration X: [name] - [description]"

Move to Iteration X+1?
```

---

## Problem Handling

### If Test Failed
```
1. Find out what went wrong
2. Propose fix
3. Agree on solution
4. Fix it
5. Ask to test again
6. DO NOT proceed until it works
```

### If Requirements Unclear
```
1. Ask specific question
2. Propose solution options
3. Wait for answer
4. Act according to answer
```

### If Need to Deviate from Plan
```
1. Explain WHY deviation is needed
2. Propose alternative
3. Wait for agreement
4. If OK - update tasklist.md
```

## Important to Remember

1. **Iteration = one unit of work**
   - Don't do multiple iterations in a row
   - After each - stop and wait

2. **Test - readiness criterion**
   - Test not passed = iteration not completed
   - No point moving forward if base doesn't work

3. **Commit - progress checkpoint**
   - Each iteration = one commit
   - Commits should be atomic

4. **Agreement - protection from rework**
   - Better discuss 5 minutes than rewrite for an hour
   - Show approach before implementation

## Summary

```
Iteration X start → Architecture agreement → OK? 
                                              ↓
Commit ← Move? ← Test OK? ← Testing ← Implementation
```

**One cycle = one iteration = one commit = one step forward**
